A visual analysis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the years 2000 to 2022. My final coursework at City, University of London for the visual analytics course

I focused on understanding how GDP has changed over time, how countries are grouped according to their GDP and if it is possible to reliably predict the GDP of a country. The analysis focuses on data collected by the World Bank. A timeseries analysis of the data is done to see how GDP has changed between the years 2000 and 2022. Then, clusters through K Means are built to see how countries naturally end up being grouped. Finally, regression models are built, specifically Linear Regression, to see if we can reliably predict GDP and what factors may have the greatest impact. The analysis will continually be supported with visuals in the form of graphs and maps to guide intuition and build understanding.
